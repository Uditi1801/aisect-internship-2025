# AISECT Python Internship â€“ 2025

This folder documents my journey through the AISECT-led Python internship program. The internship includes a structured curriculum focused on Python fundamentals, data structures, real-world examples, and beginner-friendly projects.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Learning Areas:
- Python syntax and logic building
- Control flow, functions, and file handling
- Applications in data analysis and automation

Iâ€™ll be updating this folder with notes, exercises, and mini-projects as I move through each module.


## ðŸ“š Internship Logs

### ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ Introduction to Data Analytics

**Video Watched:** "Introduction to Data Analytics"

**Key Takeaways:**
- Data Analytics = extracting meaningful insights from data
- It's used in every field: marketing, healthcare, finance, social media
- We are generating huge amounts of data daily: photos, videos, transactions

**Why It Matters:**
- Companies use analytics to improve decision-making, personalization, and growth.
- This sets the foundation for Python-based tools we'll learn (like Pandas, NumPy, etc.)
 ### ðŸ“… **Day 2: June 25, 2025**
#### âœ… Topics Covered:
- Real-life applications of Data Science:
  - Fraud detection, recommendation systems, traffic prediction, and healthcare diagnostics.
- Job roles and responsibilities in the field:
  - **Data Analyst** â€“ Analyze trends and visualize insights
